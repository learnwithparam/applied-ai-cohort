# Notes on records you can trust, and on the release

## What broke first

The acre requests. The model read 0.97 L per acre and returned 0.97 with the unit L/ha, so the record looked
valid and was well under the label. Only the match against the desk's records showed the rate was wrong by a
factor of about 2.5. That is why I now send any email that mentions acres to a person.

## What I would change before real users

I would convert acre rates myself instead of sending them all to a person, and test the conversion on its own
cases. I would also log the reason for each review, so the desk can see which rule sends them the most work.

## What I would watch after release

TODO: the number you would watch first once the service is live, and what you would do if it moved.
